(autoload 'define-arx "ample-regexps/ample-regexps" "\
Generate a custom rx-like macro under name MACRO.

See `rx' for how the generated macro can be invoked.

FORM-DEFS is a list of custom s-exp definitions to create whose
elements have the form (SYM DEF), where DEF is one of
the following:

- \"LITERAL\" -- create a matcher to match a string literally

- (regexp \"LITERAL\") -- create a match given a regexp

- SYMBOL -- create an alias for a symbol either defined earlier
  on the list or provided by `rx'

- (SUBFORM ...) -- create an alias for an application of s-exp
  subform either defined earlier on the list or provided by `rx'

- (:func #'FORM-FUNC ...) -- create an s-exp definition

The most interesting here is the last variant.  When a
corresponding rx form will be encountered, FORM-FUNC will be
called with all elements of that form as arguments (with the
first one being the form symbol itself).  FORM-FUNC must then
return a valid s-exp or a properly grouped plain regexp.

Another keywords that are recognized in the plist are:
- :min-args -- minimum number of arguments for that form (default nil)
- :max-args -- maximum number of arguments for that form (default nil)
- :predicate -- if given, all rx form arguments must satisfy it

(autoload 'csv-mode "csv-mode/csv-mode" "\
Major mode for editing files of comma-separated value type.

CSV mode is derived from `text-mode', and runs `text-mode-hook' before
running `csv-mode-hook'.  It turns `auto-fill-mode' off by default.
CSV mode can be customized by user options in the CSV customization
group.  The separators are specified by the value of `csv-separators'.

CSV mode commands ignore blank lines and comment lines beginning with
the value of `csv-comment-start', which delimit \"paragraphs\".
\"Sexp\" is re-interpreted to mean \"field\", so that `forward-sexp'
\(\\[forward-sexp]), `kill-sexp' (\\[kill-sexp]), etc. all apply to fields.
Standard comment commands apply, such as `comment-dwim' (\\[comment-dwim]).

If `font-lock-mode' is enabled then separators, quoted values and
comment lines are highlighted using respectively `csv-separator-face',
`font-lock-string-face' and `font-lock-comment-face'.

The user interface (UI) for CSV mode commands is similar to that of
the standard commands `sort-fields' and `sort-numeric-fields', except
that if there is no prefix argument then the UI prompts for the field
index or indices.  In `transient-mark-mode' only: if the region is not
set then the UI attempts to set it to include all consecutive CSV
records around point, and prompts for confirmation; if there is no
prefix argument then the UI prompts for it, offering as a default the
index of the field containing point if the region was not set
explicitly.  The region set automatically is delimited by blank lines
and comment lines, and the number of header lines at the beginning of
the region given by the value of `csv-header-lines' are skipped.

Sort order is controlled by `csv-descending'.

CSV mode provides the following specific keyboard key bindings:

You are prompted for the name of the Dired union buffer.  Completion
against names of existing Dired buffers is available, but you can
enter any other name to create a new Dired buffer of that name.

If the union buffer name you choose names an existing Dired buffer,
then what happens depends on whether that buffer is an ordinary Dired
directory listing or a list of arbitrary file names.  That is, it
depends on whether `dired-directory' is a directory name or a cons of
a Dired buffer name plus file names.

* If the buffer is an ordinary Dired listing, then it is converted to
  an explicit list of absolute file names, just as if these had been
  chosen individually.  The existing buffer and window are replaced by
  new ones that show the explicit listing.  (This replacement is
  necessary because the list of files contained in an ordinary Dired
  listing cannot be modified.)

* If the buffer lists arbitrary file names explicitly, then it is
  updated to include also the files from any Dired buffers and any
  additional files that you specify.

If the union buffer name you choose does not name an existing Dired
buffer, then its `default-directory' is the same as the
`default-directory' before invoking the command.

If you use a non-positive prefix arg, then you can next choose
additional file and directory names to add to the listing.  Use `C-g'
when done choosing them.  Any directory names you choose this way are
included as single entries in the listing - the directory contents are
not included (these directories are not unioned).

You are then prompted for the Dired buffers to union.  Use `C-g' when
done choosing them.  These Dired listings to union are included in the
order that you chose them, and each entry is listed only once in the
new Dired buffer.

The new Dired listing respects the markings, subdirectory insertions,
and hidden subdirectories of the selected Dired listings.  However, in
case of conflict between marked or unmarked status for the same entry,
the entry is marked.  Similarly, in case of conflict over an included
subdirectory between it being hidden or shown, it is hidden, but its
contained files are also listed.
